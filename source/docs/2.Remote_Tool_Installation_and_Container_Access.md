## 2.4 Docker Introduction & Usage

### 2.4.1 Docker Introduction

Docker is an open-source platform and tool that allows you to package, distribute, and run applications within containers. A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and configuration files.

By utilizing Linux's containerization technology, Docker provides efficient isolation between applications, allowing multiple containers to operate independently on the same physical device.

In essence, Docker simplifies application deployment and improves portability across different environments, making it highly convenient for software development and distribution.

### 2.4.2 Docker Commands

:::{Note}
All necessary Docker configurations have been pre-installed in the container before shipment.
:::

All of the robot's programs and functional modules run inside a Docker container. The following section introduces some commonly used Docker commands to help you better operate the system.

(1) Turn on the device. Follow the instructions in [2.1 VNC Installation and Connection](#anchor_2_1) to connect to the computer via VNC.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_4/image5.png" class="common_img" />

### 2.4.3 Check Container

Command parameters: `docker ps [OPTIONS]`

Commonly used parameters:

* **-a**: Lists all containers, including those that are currently running and those that have exited
* **-l**: Displays the most recently created container
* **-n=?:** Shows the n most recently created containers
* **-q**: Quiet mode—displays only the container IDs

Enter the following command and press **"Enter"** to display a list of running and previously run containers. The output will show the **"container ID"**, which is the unique identifier for each container, the **"image"**, which indicates the name of the image used, the **"created"** time, which shows when the container was created, and the **"status"**, which indicates the current state of the container.

```
docker ps -a
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_4/image6.png" class="common_img" />

### 2.4.4 Enter Container

Obtain the unique container ID from the output of **"2.4.3 Check Container."** Then, enter the following command to access the container containing the function programs.

```
docker exec -it -u ubuntu -w /home/ubuntu adb8 /bin/bash
```

:::{Note}
The container ID can be abbreviated as long as it remains unique to the container.

### 2.4.5 Exit Container

There are two commands for exiting containers:

* **Method 1:**

(1) Enter the command below and press "Enter". This stops the container and exits it.

```
exit
```

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_4/image8.png" class="common_img" />

* **Method 2:**

(1) Use "crtl+P+Q". This detaches from the container without stopping it. Then use `docker ps` to verify that it is still running:

```
docker ps
```

## 2.5 MentorPi Servo Deviation Adjustment

### 2.5.1 Preface

If you purchased a monocular camera version, the system includes several PWM servos that serve as the core components for steering control. Due to assembly tolerances, you may encounter slight deviations—such as the vehicle veering slightly to one side—even after the servos are powered on and set to their neutral positions.
This document provides step-by-step guidance to help you manually adjust the servo alignment and correct these deviations.

### 2.5.2 Operation Steps

(1) Start the robot and access the robot system using the remote control software VNC according to the instructions provided in [2.1 VNC Installation and Connection](#anchor_2_1).

(2) Execute the command below to disable the app auto-start service.

```
~/.stop_ros.sh
```

(3) Click-on <img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image3.png" /> and input the following command to run the deviation adjustment script.

```
./Servo.sh
```

(4) After executing the command, a pop-up window will appear as shown below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image5.png" class="common_img" />

Servo 1: Refers to the servo at the **J3** marking on the expansion board

Servo 2: Refers to the servo at the **J4** marking on the expansion board

Servo 3: Refers to the servo at the **J5** marking on the expansion board

Servo 4: Refers to the servo at the **J6** marking on the expansion board

(5) Drag the four sliders shown below to adjust the corresponding servo offsets. The servos will rotate in real time during the adjustment, allowing you to observe their movement and fine-tune the deviation accordingly.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(6) If you're not satisfied with the adjustment results, click the 'Set Center Position' button to reset all servo offsets to their default center positions and readjust as needed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(7) After adjusting the servos to the desired positions, click the 'Save Offsets' button to save the calibration settings.

Below is the storage path.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image7.png" class="common_img" />

The following file will be saved:

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_2/section_5/image8.png" class="common_img" />

After completing this step, the offset values will be stored. In all future applications involving the servos, this offset file will be automatically loaded to compensate for any servo deviations.

(8) You may also enter the following command and press Enter to launch the chassis control node and verify that the offset values have been applied correctly.

```
ros2 launch ros_robot_controller ros_robot_controller.launch.py
```

It can be confirmed that the offset values have been successfully saved to the file and can be correctly loaded in other applications.
